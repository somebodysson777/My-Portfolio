            <span><u>Dream Of Time by Nancy J. Price.</u></span>
            Each night, when
            <span><u>Robin</u></span>
            drifts off to sleep, she finds herself dreaming about the life of a woman in the Victorian age. She soon realizes its not a dream, but she's truly slipping into 
            <span><u>San Francisco's</u></span>
            past. While living two lives, one as a mom in the
            <span><i><b>modern</b></i></span>
            day, the other as a
            <span><I><b>proper young</b></I></span>
            lady at the turn of the century-she discovers how she's being sent back to a 
            <span><i><b>bygone</b></i></span>
            era is only the first mystery. A much more 
            <span><i><b>important</b></i></span>
            question is why is she here. With the help of a
            <span><i><b>rookie</b></i></span>
            police officer,
            <span><u>Robin</u></span>
            takes off on a
            <span><i><b>spell-binding</b></i></span>
            adventure, sifting through a century's worth of clues to untangle the past - and to put love to the test. History tho, proves itself a 
            <span><i><b>worthy</b></i></span>
            opponent, and the she comes to experience firsthand how destiny can be
            <span><i><b>kind</b></i></span>
            and 
            <span><i><b>cruel</b></i></span>
            in the same stroke.
